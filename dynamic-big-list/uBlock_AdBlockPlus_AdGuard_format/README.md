# EasyList Filter Syntax / Static Filter Syntax

Reference about the syntax mentioned [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax)

----

## Should work with Adguard, uBlock Origin, AdblockPlus.

Originally for Pi-hole these [lists](https://github.com/lwsnz/pihole/tree/main/dynamic-big-list).

With some regex magic, we add ```||``` to the start of each line. 

So it apparently becomes usable syntax in the likes of Adguard, uBlock Origin, AdblockPlus etc.
