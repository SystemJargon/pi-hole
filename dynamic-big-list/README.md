## Update Frequency of list/s


Any list/s in this folder should be updated regularly and automatically in an ideal world / best efforts.

A date and time stamp should be added to the list/s at the top to show, "last updated". 

Currently this is daily just after 12pm NZT time (+12 hours ahead of UTC). It is automated.

## What is in the list/s?

Any list/s within are a combination of my custom entries and from other lists. 

Filenames should contain some of the purpose of what it blocklists. Example phishing, malware, nsfw.
