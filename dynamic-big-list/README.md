## Update Frequency of list/s


Any list/s should be updated regularly and automatically in an ideal world / best efforts.

<!-- Currently this is daily just after 9am NZ time. It is automated via script. -->

A date and time stamp should be added to the list/s at the top to show, "last updated".

----

## What is in the list/s?

Any list/s within are a combination of my custom entries and from other lists. 

Filenames should contain some of the purpose of what it blocklists. Example phishing, malware, nsfw.
