Some lists for Pi-hole found on firebog website. 

Sometimes these lists disappear or change, may not get regular maintained updates.

That's fine, so I made a copy of the main one's I find useful and that in most cases, don't trigger false positives / least whitelisting exceptions required.



All kudos to original authors of the lists and their contributors.
